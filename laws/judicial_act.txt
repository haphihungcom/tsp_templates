[anchor=_s1][/anchor][p](1) Justices of the High Court shall [/p]

[b][p]Article 3: Case Procedure[/p][/b]


[anchor=_s1][/anchor][p](1) A case is submitted to the High Court via a public post in the High Court area by any individual authorized to submit a case of the given type. A case can be a legal question, an appeal, an indictment, or a sentencing.[/p]


[anchor=_s2][/anchor][p](2) The High Court will determine with reasonable speed whether a case is justiciable. If found justiciable, a justice will be assigned to the case, otherwise the case is unappealably dismissed.[/p]


[anchor=_s3][/anchor][p](3) Any member of the South Pacific may request the recusal of the assigned justice at any time, which will be reviewed by the High Court. If granted, the High Court will assign another justice.[/p]


[anchor=_s4][/anchor][p](4) Any member of the South Pacific may submit information, evidence, or opinions on the matter. To facilitate this, a case may not run for less than 72 hours. [/p]

[anchor=_s3][/anchor][p](3) The assigned justice will deliver with the opinion a verdict for each indictment contained within the case.

[b][p]Article 6: Sentencing[/p][/b]


[anchor=_s1][/anchor][p](1) A sentencing case is started when an individual has been found guilty after being indicted. The case is started, if possible, by the justice that delivered the conviction.[/p]

[anchor=_s1][/anchor][p](1) By default, material submitted for a case shall be submitted alongside the case proceedings in a public venue.[/p]


[anchor=_s2][/anchor][p](2) Material that is confidential and may harm regional security may be submitted to the Court, provided that the Court works with the corresponding authority to redact the information that may harm regional security.[/p]


[anchor=_s3][/anchor][p](3) Material that is of a personal nature, such as as that which reveals personally identifiable information or which would otherwise unreasonably violate personal privacy, may be provided to the Court on a confidential basis, and published in a redacted form only if a reasonable person could not deduce the identity being protected.
