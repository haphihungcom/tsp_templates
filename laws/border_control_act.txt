[b][anchor=a1][/anchor][p]1. Definitions[/p][/b]


[anchor=a1_s1][/anchor][p](1) A border control officer is a nation in the South Pacific that, by virtue of being the legal World Assembly Delegate, or by being appointed as Regional Officer with Border Control powers by a legal Delegate, has the ability to eject or ban nations from the South Pacific.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s2][/anchor][p](2) A low influence nation is a nation in the South Pacific that holds an influence score in the South Pacific less than or equal to the maximum attainable influence score of a nation without endorsements.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s3][/anchor][p](3) A border control action is the act of ejecting or banning a nation from the South Pacific performed by a border control officer. A maximum valid length of a ban may be exceeded if a criminal complaint has been filed and assigned a case number in that time, in which case it may last until the court has issued a verdict and sentence.[/p]



[b][anchor=a2][/anchor][p]2. Powers of the Council on Regional Security[/p][/b]


[anchor=a2_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Council on Regional Security may order a border control action when they determine that a nation is contributing to a probable imminent threat of the World Assembly Delegate position being seized by nation other than the legal holder of that position, for up to a week or the time necessary for that nation's influence in the South Pacific to decay to the level of a low influence nation, whichever is longer.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s2][/anchor][p](2) The Council on Regional Security may order a border control action lasting up to 24 hours against a nation that continuously and defiantly violates the endorsement cap.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s3][/anchor][p](3) The Council of Regional Security may order a border control action against a nation which is, with probable cause, controlled by the same player as another nation currently subject to a border control action, for the duration of the original nation's border control action.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s4][/anchor][p](4) The Council on Regional Security must immediately inform the Cabinet and the Delegate, and inform the Assembly within 24 hours, of having ordered a border control action.[/p]



[b][anchor=a3][/anchor][p]3. Powers of the Local Council and Delegate[/p][/b]


[anchor=a3_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Delegate, or a majority of the Local Council, may order a border control action against a nation they determine to be spammers or trolls. The assent of the Council on Regional Security is required if the nation in question is not a low influence nation.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s2][/anchor][p](2) The Delegate or Local Council must inform the Council on Regional Security immediately after having ordered a border control action.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s3][/anchor][p](3) The Local Council may enact policy allowing border control actions within its purview to be performed unilaterally by a border control officer. Any change to such a policy must be clearly and immediately communicated to all border control officers.[/p]



[b][anchor=a4][/anchor][p]4. Rights of Border Control Officers[/p][/b]


[anchor=a4_s1][/anchor][p](1) Border control officers ordered to perform a border control action by an institution they are not a member of are granted immunity for executing that order.[/p]


[anchor=a4_s2][/anchor][p](2) Border control officers may unilaterally perform a border control action to prevent probable imminent invasions of the South Pacific in the minutes leading up to the game update of the South Pacific, which they must report to the Council on Regional Security immediately.
