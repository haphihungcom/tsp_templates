[anchor=aIX_s4][/anchor][p](4) If applying directly to the Council, applicants should explain why they are well suited to protect regional security. Applications will remain private.

[anchor=aIX_s5][/anchor][p](5) The Delegate and Prime Minister may jointly nominate any person meeting the requirements for membership and who are well suited to protect regional security. Prior to the nomination, the Delegate and Prime Minister will consult with the Council for their advice. To ensure collegiality and prevent dysfunction, if two-thirds of the members of the Council object to the prospective nominee’s membership, the nomination will not move forward. If no such objection exists, then the nomination will be submitted to the Assembly for approval via simple majority vote.[/p]


[anchor=aIX_s6][/anchor][p](6) Continued membership in the Council on Regional Security is predicated upon meeting eligibility requirements.

[anchor=aIX_s7][/anchor][p](7) If a majority of the Council deems a member to be a threat to regional security, they will be suspended from the Council pending an official investigation and report to the Assembly.

[anchor=aIX_s8][/anchor][p](8) Participation, in whole or in part and at any time, in any coup d’etat or invasion of the Coalition or any of its allies will disqualify a prospective or sitting member from membership in the Council on Regional Security immediately and permanently. Participation in normal raiding, defending, or liberation efforts as part of an organized military will not be considered a violation of this clause.[/p]



[i][p]Powers[/p][/i]


[anchor=aIX_s9][/anchor][p](9) The Council on Regional Security will be responsible for establishing an appropriate cap on endorsements, ensuring that such a cap is not detrimental to the growth of the region. Enforcement of the endorsement cap should be done with leniency if a violator does not pose a significant risk to regional security.[/p]


[anchor=aIX_s10][/anchor][p](10) During a coup d’etat, whether committed by outside forces, infiltrators, or duly elected officials, the Council on Regional Security may declare a state of emergency, until such a time that a legitimate government is restored.

[anchor=aX_s2][/anchor][p](2) The military will be led by the Minister of Military Affairs, along with a corps of generals appointed by the Minister and approved by the Assembly. The Minister and general corps may establish further hierarchy, create programs, and appoint deputies as they see necessary.[/p]


[anchor=aX_s3][/anchor][p](3) The military will have the support of the Coalition in conducting operations to protect innocent regions from attack and oppression and promote legitimate, native democratic institutions across the world. The military may not colonize or annex any region without the express permission of the Cabinet and the Assembly, by majority vote of both chambers.

[anchor=aXI_s1_a][/anchor][p]a. Recalls should only be initiated for dereliction of duty, abuse of authority, or violations of the law, and not for purposes of political rivalry.[/p]
[anchor=aXI_s1_b][/anchor][p]b. Upon initiation, recall resolutions must be debated for three days and receive a motion and second before being put to vote. [/p]
[anchor=aXI_s1_c][/anchor][p]c. Upon passage, the recalled official will immediately be removed from office.[/p]


[anchor=aXI_s2][/anchor][p](2) A Motion of No Confidence may be initiated by the Assembly if the members have lost faith in the effectiveness and activities of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.

[anchor=aXII_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Forum Administration Team will be responsible for the technical maintenance of the forums and the integrity of the database. Administrators will not be given responsibilities of a political nature.[/p]

Bills that may exist as general laws, as determined by the Chair of the Assembly, should not be placed in the Charter or constitutional laws.[/p]


[anchor=aXIII_s2][/anchor][p](2) Any amendment to the Charter or constitutional laws that directly affects the gameside community or its home governance, as determined by the Chair of the Assembly, must also be debated and voted upon by the gameside community.

[i][p]Setting a procedure for constitutional conventions.[/p][/i]


[anchor=aXIV_s1][/anchor][p](1) When the Assembly wishes to debate the fundamental principles and structures of the Coalition, it may call a Great Council to rewrite all laws in their entirety, or establish a new state for the South Pacific.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s2][/anchor][p](2) A resolution establishing a Great Council may be adopted with a three-fifths supermajority of the Assembly, which must be confirmed by a majority vote of the gameside community.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s3][/anchor][p](3) The purpose of a Great Council is to rewrite all laws from the ground up, not merely to amend existing ones. The Assembly should use the normal amendment process for basic amendments, reserving Great Councils for a time when extreme changes are necessary and proper.[/p]


[anchor=aXIV_s4][/anchor][p](4) Any and all changes to regional law proposed by a Great Council may be adopted by a three-fifths supermajority of the Assembly, which must be confirmed by a majority vote of the game-side community.[/p]
