[align=center][b][p]Sunshine Act[/p][/b][/align]
[align=center][i][p]An act to periodically publish threads in private government forums[/p][/i][/align]


[b][anchor=a1][/anchor][p]1. Documentation[/p][/b]


[anchor=a1_s1][/anchor][p](1) Discussion within a government institution that leads to a motion or a decision by that institution into taking deliberate action or inaction beyond that institution's inner working area is to be considered significant discussion.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s2][/anchor][p](2) All significant private discussions of government institutions must be documented on the regional forums for the purpose of persistence and posterity. [/p]


[anchor=a1_s3][/anchor][p](3) Significant discussions occurring via real-time communication methods may be quoted verbatim or reasonably summarized on the forums, as deemed most reasonable by that institution. If the communication via such a method cannot be saved, meeting minutes must be taken of that discussion. [/p]



[b][anchor=a2][/anchor][p]2. Publishing of Discussions[/p][/b]


[anchor=a2_s1][/anchor][p](1) The significant discussions of an institution shall, in due time, be released for public archival accessible to all members of the South Pacific. [/p]


[anchor=a2_s2][/anchor][p](2) The release of discussions shall occur at the following times:[/p]
[anchor=a2_s2_a][/anchor][p]a. For a Cabinet term, discussions from the Cabinet shall be released no later than 6 months after the completion of that term.[/p]
[anchor=a2_s2_b][/anchor][p]b. For a High Court case, they shall be released no later than 6 months after the ruling or, if appealed, the ruling on the appeal, has been announced.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s3][/anchor][p](3) Discussions may be withheld from release if[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_a][/anchor][p]a. they are ongoing or directly related to another ongoing discussion, [/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_b][/anchor][p]b. if the public release of information contained therein threatens the security of the region or an ally,[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_c][/anchor][p]c. if any personally identifiable information is contained therein, or[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_d][/anchor][p]d. if they contain diplomatic conversations with other regions or organizations.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s4][/anchor][p](4) A discussion may be released in a redacted form by copying the discussion and censoring information not intended for public consumption. The normative copy of the discussion thread must then remain in the private forum. [/p]


[anchor=a2_s5][/anchor][p](5) If reasonably possible, the institution should strive to release discussions containing classified information in redacted form, rather than withholding them. Any personally identifiable information must always be redacted upon release.[/p]



[b][anchor=a3][/anchor][p]3. Audits of Discussions[/p][/b]


[anchor=a3_s1][/anchor][p](1) The High Court, as part of a case, may compel an institution to grant the Court insight into related discussions.	[/p]
