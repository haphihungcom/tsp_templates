[align=center][b][p]Legislator Committee Act[/p][/b]

[i][p]An act to establish a commission to manage legislators[/p][/i][/align]


[b][anchor=a1][/anchor][p]1. Scope[/p][/b]


[anchor=a1_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Legislator Committee is the commission responsible for granting and revoking legislator status to members.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s2][/anchor][p](2) The Legislator Committee comprises three legislators that have each been appointed by the cabinet and approved by the assembly via a simple majority vote.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s3][/anchor][p](3) A member of the Legislator Committee is removed from the committee if[/p]
[anchor=a1_s3_a][/anchor][p]a. the member resigns, or[/p]
[anchor=a1_s3_b][/anchor][p]b. the member loses legislator eligibility, or[/p]
[anchor=a1_s3_c][/anchor][p]c. the member is recalled by the Assembly through regular order.[/p]


[anchor=a1_s4][/anchor][p](4) If there is no member of the Legislator Committee available due to vacancy or leave, and there are outstanding duties to be performed, the Cabinet may appoint an emergency member to handle any urgent matters of the committee. The Council on Regional Security may, on security grounds only, rescind the Cabinet's appointment. The emergency member's tenure will last until the Cabinet rescinds the appointment or until one week after a regular committee member is available, whichever happens sooner.[/p]



[b][anchor=a2][/anchor][p]2. Legislator Applications[/p][/b]


[anchor=a2_s1][/anchor][p](1) Any member of the Coalition is eligible to attain legislator status if[/p]
[anchor=a2_s1_a][/anchor][p]a. the Legislator Committee does not opine that they are seeking membership in bad faith,[/p]
[anchor=a2_s1_b][/anchor][p]b. they have a nation in the South Pacific,[/p]
[anchor=a2_s1_c][/anchor][p]c. are not attempting to join with multiple nations or identities, and[/p]
[anchor=a2_s1_d][/anchor][p]d. are not considered by the Council on Regional Security to be a significant risk to regional security.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s2][/anchor][p](2) A member of the Coalition may attain legislator status through an application with the Legislator Committee. The Committee shall confirm the reception of an application within 48 hours. The Committee will determine the eligibility of the applicant, consulting any other institutions of the Coalition as needed to inform its decision, and shall strive to accept or deny each applicant within a week.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s3][/anchor][p](3) An application for legislator status must include at least[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_a][/anchor][p]a. the current nation in the South Pacific,[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_b][/anchor][p]b. any colloquial aliases of the individual in use within the last year, or in prominent use longer than a year ago,[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_c][/anchor][p]c. the current World Assembly nation of the individual (in case of a floating World Assembly membership, the applicant may list multiple nations such that World Assembly membership can be traced throughout the application process), and[/p]
[anchor=a2_s3_d][/anchor][p]d. a pledge to uphold the laws of the Coalition of the South Pacific.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s4][/anchor][p](4) The Legislator Committee may request additional legitimation steps from applicants, such as requesting a telegram from a World Assembly nation. An applicant may choose to publicly withhold some information and only disclose it to the Council on Regional Security in case of reasonable concerns of confidentiality.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s5][/anchor][p](5) Upon acceptance or denial of an application, the Legislator Committee shall post the result (including a sufficient reason in case of a denial) both in response to the application as well as per telegram to the applicant nation.[/p]


[anchor=a2_s6][/anchor][p](6) Anyone admitted to legislator status during a forum election in which only legislators may vote, from the time nominations begin until the conclusion of forum voting, may not stand for election nor vote in that forum election.[/p]



[b][anchor=a3][/anchor][p]3. Legislator Checks[/p][/b]


[anchor=a3_s1][/anchor][p](1) Continued legislator status requires active membership and good behaviour.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s2][/anchor][p](2) Within the first week of each calendar month, the Legislator Committee will remove legislator status from a legislator if they failed the voting requirement in the past month, if applicable, or otherwise no longer meet the eligibility requirements as described herein. If a legislator no longer meets the eligibility requirements (not including the voting requirement), and it would be impossible for them to meet the requirements before the first week of the following calendar month, the Legislator Committee may remove their legislator status at their discretion before the appointed week. The Legislator Committee may exercise discretion and not remove legislators under reasonable extenuating circumstances.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s3][/anchor][p](3) A legislator fails the voting requirement if they are absent for more than half of all votes finished in the previous calendar month, if a minimum of two votes occurred. Legislators who have an approved leave of absence from the Chair shall not be considered absent for votes in the given time frame.[/p]


[anchor=a3_s4][/anchor][p](4) The Chair of the Assembly may order the Legislator Committee to suspend legislator privileges for disruptive members. Frequent suspensions may be grounds for ineligibility, if found appropriate in a fair trial by the High Court.[/p]



[b][anchor=a4][/anchor][p]4. Constitutional Law[/p][/b]


[anchor=a4_s1][/anchor][p](1) The Legislator Committee Act is a constitutional law, and further amendments to it must meet constitutional amendment requirements.	[/p]
