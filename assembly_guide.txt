[anchor=intro_intro][/anchor][h1]INTRODUCTION[/h1]

[p]Welcome to the Assembly! This is the place where legislation is created and decisions that impact the South Pacific's community are made. This dispatch will guide you through how to participate in the Assembly, including making, debating, and voting on laws![/p]

[p]Before continuing, you should read [url=politics_guide]the guide on our politics[/url], which introduces you to how our government works and our political environment. If you have done that, you are good to continue.[/p]

[p]Let's review the powers of the Assembly:[/p]
[list]
[*]It makes laws which regulate our community.
[*]It elects [url=cabinet_intro]the Cabinet[/url], the head of our executive branch.
[*]It elects [url=delegate_intro]the Delegate[/url], our head of state.
[*]It approves appointments of [url=court_intro]High Court justices[/url], [url=crs_intro]CRS members[/url], and others.
[*]It also does other stuff you don't need to know now. (Read [url=assembly_details]this[/url] if you want to know anyway.)
[/list]

[p]Members of the Assembly are called [i]legislators[/i] and they join the Assembly by [url=become_legislator]voluntarily signing up[/url] for it.[/p]

[h3]Where is the Assembly?[/h3]

[p]Business of the Assembly happens in [url=f_assembly_hall]the Assembly Halls[/url] part of our forum. Here, you can find discussion threads, where legislators post drafts of legislation and discuss them. You can also find [url=f_legislator_loa]a thread pinned near the top[/url] where you can post leaves of absence (LoA) or resignations. There are two more subforums within the Assembly Halls: [url=f_voting_chamber]the Voting Chamber[/url], where we vote on legislation, and the [url=f_private_assembly_hall]Private Assembly Hall[/url], where we discuss sensitive matters.[/p]

[h3]What do I do in the Assembly?[/h3]

[p]95% of the time, the Assembly is all about writing, debating, and voting on legislation, the remaining 5% are elections which we cover [url=elections]here[/url]. In the Assembly, you can participate in discussions on proposed legislation, vote on legislation, and of course, propose new legislation. Keep reading for more details![/p]

[h3]Where can I find the laws and do I have to know them?[/h3]

[p]Laws passed by the Assembly are archived in the [url=law_index]Law Archive[/url]. You don't need to know every law there, you just need to be generally aware of how our government works and what the legislative procedure is. When writing legislation (discussed below), you will have to read related laws to avoid conflicts. However, there isn't too much to read since we don't have a lot of laws, and our laws are usually short and written in non-fancy English.[/p]

[h3]Understanding the matters being discussed in the Assembly[/h3]

[p]If you are a beginner, you may not understand the issues and problems being discussed. The quickest way to understand them is asking other legislators, who will enthusiastically explain them for you! You can also read the [url=news_outlets]latest news[/url], or if you prefer the raw approach, read some of the laws in [url=law_index]the Law Archive[/url] or [url=index]browse the dispatches[/url].[/p]

[p]This part of the guide already gives you most of the knowledge needed to participate in the Assembly. Below, you'll read about how legislation is made along with how to write, propose, debate, and vote on one.[/p]

[h3]The Chair of Assembly[/h3]

[p]Most of the moderation and paperwork matters in the Assembly is handled by the [url=coa]Chair of Assembly[/url], who is elected by legislators. {{ gov_officials.coa|nation }} is our current Chair.[/p]

[h3]The Code of Conduct[/h3]

[p]To make sure legislators behave orderly in the Assembly, we have a short [url=f_assembly_coc]Code of Conduct[/url] you should read and follow.[/p]

[hr]

[anchor=process][/anchor][h1]THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS[/h1]

[p]Now that you know the introduction, let's learn how to actually make laws and participate in legislative business. As you have read above, the main job of the Assembly is to make laws, resolutions, approve treaties, etc. (these are collectively known as [i]legislation[/i]). In the Assembly, any legislation has to go through four steps before it goes into effect:[/p]
[list]
[*][url=#proposal][b]Proposal:[/b][/url] A legislator will draft the legislation they want to enact and post it on the Assembly forum. The draft can be a new law, amendments to existing laws, repeal of existing laws, resolutions, etc., or just rough ideas for discussion before actually writing a legislation.
[*][url=#debate][b]Debate:[/b][/url] After legislation has been proposed, other legislators will debate it, talking about why and how it is needed, making corrections, changes, offering comments, etc. After going through this step, most legislation has either slightly or significantly changed from the original draft proposed or sometimes outright dropped.
[*][url=#motion][b]Motion to vote:[/b][/url] After the mandatory debate period (which varies based on the type of legislation), legislators may motion the legislation to vote, and other legislators may second that motion. However, if there's still debate going on, the Chair may delay the vote.
[*][url=#vote][b]Vote:[/b][/url] After receiving a seconded motion, the legislation is brought to a vote. If there are enough votes (depends on the type of legislation), the legislation will pass and go into effect.
[/list]

[p]The process is the pretty similar for almost everything else the Assembly does (resolutions, treaties, appointment approvals, etc.) except [url=elections]elections[/url]. The length of the mandatory debate period and votes varies depending on the type of legislation.[/p]

[p]The sections below will explain each of the steps in detail and guide you on how to participate in them.[/p]

[hr]

[anchor=types][/anchor][h1]Types of legislation[/h1]

[p]There are few formal definitions on types of legislation we have. However, we typically deal with these kinds of legislation:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]Law:[/em] A set of rules everyone in the region must comply with.
[*][em]Treaty:[/em] A set of agreements between us and other regions.
[*][em]Amendment:[/em] Changes to existing legislation.
[*][em]Appointment approval:[/em] Used to approve the appointment of someone to a government office.
[*][em]Resolution:[/em] Everything else such as recalls, requests for the government to do something, statements, etc.
[/list]

[p]Based on the degree of importance, legislation can be categorized into:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]General legislation:[/em] General laws, amendments, resolutions, appointment approvals, treaties, etc.
[*][em]Constitutional legislation:[/em] Laws, amendments, resolutions which form the foundation of our community, are considered fundamental to governance, or otherwise are considered of great importance (such as the Charter, election laws, etc.)
[/list]

[p]Don't get overwhelmed about the types since you don't need to clarify it when writing your legislation and the legislative process for all legislation types is the same.[/p]
[/box]

[box][anchor=proposal][/anchor]
{{ headers.gen_sub_header(urls={'Begin writing': '#proposal_intro',
                                'Formatting': '#formatting',
                                'Posting': '#post'},
                          title='PROPOSING & WRITING LEGISLATION') }}

[hr]

[anchor=propose][/anchor][h1]BEGIN WRITING YOUR LEGISLATION[/h1]

[p]The start of a new legislation is the proposal step. Any legislator can propose a legislation to the Assembly. Useful note: a piece of proposed legislation is called a [i]bill[/i].The process is very simple, although you will need to pay attention to the formatting of your legislation.[/p]

[p]If you are a beginner, you probably don't need to know how to write bills yet. You should jump to the [url=#debate]debating[/url] and [url=#vote]voting[/url] section below and skip this part if you want.[/p]

[h3]Find a problem to work on[/h3]

[p]Our region has a multitude of problems to be fixed and improvements to be made. You can go through [url=law_index]the Law Archive[/url]to find laws with loopholes, laws which fail at addressing the related problems, you can read [url=news_outlets]the news[/url], or just hear from someone that there is problem that needs to be fixed. Again, ask other legislators if you don't know anything![/p]

[h3]Read the Law Archive first![/h3]

[p]Before writing your bill, you should look over [url=law_index]the Law Archive[/url] first to see if there are any laws that conflict with your bill or already does what your bill does. You can use the names of the laws to determine which laws to look at. For example, if you are writing a bill on elections, you should look at the [law]Elections Act[/law] first.[/p]

[h3]Writing your bill[/h3]

[p]Once you have picked a problem to work on, you can begin working on how to fix it! For normal bills, just jump into writing it right away. Start a new thread on the [url=f_assembly_hall]Assembly Hall[/url] or the [url=f_private_assembly_hall]Private Hall[/url] (if your bill is about sensitive matters) part of our forum by clicking the [i]Post Thread[/i] button near the top of the forum and start writing. A bill is really just a list of rules the region has to comply, you just need to list the rules you want to have out. For example, if you want to force our beloved former Delegate [nation]Erinor[/nation] to not change his name on our [url=discord]Discord server[/url], draft a bill like this:[/p]
[quote=SERAPH Act;0][center][p]SERAPH Act[/p][/center]

[center][p]An Act to Secure Eternal Reference and Assuredly Plausible Historicity[/p][/center]

[p]1. This Act shall be known in full as the Securing Eternal Reference and Assuredly Plausible Historicity Act.[/p]

[p]2. This Act shall be known in short as the SERAPH Act.[/p]

[p]3. Seraph shall be forbidden from changing his nickname on the regional chat.[/p]

[p]4. Should Seraph change his nickname, a chat moderator or administrator shall change it back to 'Seraph'.[/p]

[p]5. This Act shall not be enacted.[/p]

[p]6. Should this Act be enacted, it will be considered repealed after being in force for a full day.[/p]
[/quote]

[p]You may notice that the language is very formal. If you are not used to this style, you should collaborate with a more experienced legislator or read existing laws in [url=law_index]the Law Archive[/url] to get a hang of the style.[/p]

[p]If your bill is big and affects many aspects of the region, then you may want to consider starting a discussion thread and posting your rough ideas first for other to comment on before drafting the actual bill.[/p]

[hr]

[anchor=formatting][/anchor][h1]FORMAT YOUR BILL[/h1]

[p]The formatting of your bill must comply with the standards specified in the [law]Law Standards Act[/law] for consistency. If you don't like to do the formatting job yourself, you can ask others to do it. You can use the buttons at the top of our forum's post editor to help format your work. The Law Standards Act it is rather long, but here are the basics:[/p]
[list]
[*]Your bill should have a title (e.g. the South Pacific Iced Tea Regulation Act). The title should be bolded and centered at the top.
[*]You should also have a short subtitle which summarizes what your bill does. It should be italicized, centered, and placed below the title. (e.g. An Act to control the distribution of Iced Tea in the South Pacific)
[*]Each section should be numbered with parentheses at the beginning. If you only have one section then you don't need to do this.
[spoiler=[p]Click to view example...[/p]][quote=Example;0][p](1) Adding salt to iced tea is prohibited.[/p]

[p](2) Changes in the formula of iced tea shall be approved by the Commission on Iced Tea Regulation.[/p]

[p](3) Waste iced tea shall be disposed in approved recycle facilities.[/p]
[/quote][/spoiler]
[*]If a section has sub-sections then the sub-sections need to be lettered with lowercase letters at the beginning.
[spoiler=[p]Click to view example...[/p]][quote=Example;0][p](1) Addition of the following ingredients to iced tea is prohibited:[/p]
[p]a. Salt[/p]
[p]b. Pepper[/p]
[p]c. Alcohol[/p]

[p](2) Changes in the formula of iced tea shall be approved by the Commission on Iced Tea Regulation.[/p]

[p](3) Waste iced tea shall be disposed in approved recycle facilities.[/p]
[/quote][/spoiler]
[*]You should group sections with the same subject into an article. Articles should be numbered and bolded.
[spoiler=[p]Click to view example...[/p]][quote=Example;0][p][b]1. Scope[/b][/p]

[p](1) Iced tea is defined as an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over tea leaf then adding ice in.[/p]

[p](2) The production, distribution, and consumption of iced tea in the Coalition shall be regulated by this Act.[/p]

[p][b]2. Commission on Iced Tea Regulation[/b][/p]

[p](1) The Commission on Iced Tea Regulation is the commission responsible for enforcing the regulation described in this Act.[/p]

[p](2) The Commission on Iced Tea Regulation comprises three legislators that have each been appointed by the Cabinet and approved by the Assembly via a simple majority vote.[/p]
[/quote][/spoiler]
[*]If your bill has addendums, add them at the end of your bill, number them, and place them in a quote box. We rarely use addendum in laws, though the [law]Law Standards Act[/law] itself contains an example of this at the bottom.
[/list]

[p]Using these rules, we can reformat our SERAPH Act above as follow to comply with the standard:[/p]
[quote=SERAPH Act;0][center][p][b]SERAPH Act[/b][/p][/center]
[center][p][i]An Act to Secure Eternal Reference and Assuredly Plausible Historicity[/i][/p][/center]

[p][b]1. Naming[/b][/p]

[p](1) This Act shall be known in full as the Securing Eternal Reference and Assuredly Plausible Historicity Act.[/p]

[p](2) This Act shall be known in short as the SERAPH Act.[/p]

[p][b]2. Dispositions[/b][/p]

[p](1) Seraph shall be forbidden from changing his nickname on the regional chat.[/p]

[p](2) Should Seraph change his nickname, a chat moderator or administrator shall change it back to 'Seraph'.[/p]

[p][b]3. Final Dispositions[/b][/p]

[p](1) This Act shall not be enacted.[/p]

[p](2) Should this Act be enacted, it will be considered repealed after being in force for a full day.[/p]
[/quote]

[h3]Amendments[/h3]

[p]If your bill is an amendment, which means a set of changes to existing laws, then the formatting rules are the same, except for a few things:[/p]
[list]
[*]You don't need to include the whole law with your changes in, just quote the section where the changes are made and omit the rest. Use the ellipses to indicate the parts you omit. Note that you cannot omit the title of the law and the article of the section you are amending since people need to know where the section you are amending is in the law.
[*]When amending a law, you will add and remove some text from it. Mark your additions with green color and deletions with red color and strike-through.
[/list]

[p]Example of an amendment on Section 7, Article IV of the Charter of the South Pacific to change how [url=lc_intro]the Local Council[/url] participates in the Assembly:[/p]
[quote=Example;0][center][p][b]The Charter of the South Pacific[/b][/p][/center]

...

[p][b]IV. THE LOCAL COUNCIL[/b][/p]

...

[p]7. The Local Council representative will [color=#32cd32]have the power to cast[/color] [strike][color=#ff0000]have[/color][/strike] a[color=#32cd32]n additional[/color] weighted [color=#32cd32]block[/color] vote [color=#32cd32]worth[/color] [strike][color=#ff0000]of[/color][/strike] [color=#32cd32]one-fifth[/color] [strike][color=#ff0000]20%[/color][/strike] of all non-abstaining votes cast on bills, [color=#32cd32]not including the block vote, giving them a one-sixth share of the total vote, excluding abstentions[/color]. The Chair will calculate how many votes are allotted to the representative at the close of each vote, [color=#32cd32]rounding them to the nearest whole number,[/color] and [color=#32cd32]will[/color] then add the representative's total votes to the final tally.[/p]
[/quote]

[p]You can see that everything else except the section, its article, and the title of the Charter is omitted and replaced with ellipses. The new text is colored green and the removed text is struck through and colored red.[/p]

[p]While not required, there are some custom codes that you can use on the forums when formatting your bill. You can use [bill] and [/bill] around your bill, which formats your bill into something that looks very similar to a quote box but removes the "Someone Wrote" part of the quote box. When proposing legislation, especially amendments, it's generally recommended to put your legislation in quotes or in the bill formatting. You can also use [bill-add] and [/bill-add] around the things you are adding in an amendment. This code formats the words in between the codes to be green. [bill-subtract] and [/bill-subtract] can be used around words to produce text that is red and has a strike-through, for when you are indicating that you are removing things in your amendment.

[hr]

[anchor=post][/anchor][h1]POSTING YOUR LEGISLATION[/h1]

[p]After you have done all the hard work of writing and formatting your bill, now it is time to post it for other legislators to see. There are two places where you can post new bill:[/p]
[list]
[*][url=f_private_assembly_hall][b]The Private Assembly Hall:[/b][/url] Post on this place if your bill contains sensitive matters such as military, security, intelligence policies, treaties, etc. These should be things that you think the public shouldn't see in general.
[*][url=f_assembly_hall][b]The Assembly Hall:[/b][/url] For everything else, just post on this place. It is visible to the public.
[/list]

[p]There is no punishment if you post on the wrong place, and the Chair of Assembly will usually correct that for you.[/p]

[p]After you have posted your bill draft, the next step is debating your bill with others.[/p]

[/box]

[box][anchor=debate][/anchor]

{{ headers.gen_sub_header(urls={'Introduction': '#debate_intro',
                                'Debate period': '#debate_period'},
                          title='DEBATING') }}

[hr]

[anchor=debate_intro][/anchor][h1]INTRODUCTION TO DEBATING[/h1]

[p]After a bill has been proposed, the next step is debating and adjusting the draft before putting it to vote. This step doesn't have any procedure or requirements you must abide by, aside from the time you must debate for before you can motion to vote.[/p]

[p]In this step, you and others discuss the ins and outs of the draft, why and how the bill will work, what are the downsides, alternatives, etc., and make changes to it. Debates happen in the thread the bill is posted, as well as in #legislators-lounge on Discord. Most normal bills are slightly or significantly altered when going through this stage, some may get dropped completely. When debating, the bill's proposers will receive questions, complements, and criticisms, just like in real-life political debates. When you are arguing for your bill, keep in mind that the responses from others aimed at [i]your work[/i], not you, so don't be discouraged when someone criticizes the bill.[/p]

[h3]Don't fear but also don't attack others[/h3]

[p]When debating, remember that this is just a game, people will give your bill or opinions their own opinions, sometimes harshly, to make your bill better and more representative of the best interests of the South Pacific's citizens. No one will think you are a dumb noob or is a <insert insulting adjective> player if you post a bad bill or opinion, especially if you are a beginner. Don't feel intimidated by others when they question or criticize you, and of course, don't retaliate back by throwing flame at them. Calm, respectful conversations and discussions are best practices in the Assembly (and everywhere else in this game and in real-life).[/p]

[p]Debates in the Assembly are moderated by both the Chair of Assembly as well as normal moderators. Heated arguments with swear words are tolerable but if personal attacks and other dirty debate techniques like trolling, baiting, or gaslighting are involved, then moderation actions will be carried out. [b]Always keep in mind that this is just a game[/b]. Finally, if you don't know anything, or need to fact-check something, [b]ask other legislators[/b], they will gladly help you![/p]

[hr]

[anchor=debate_period][/anchor][h1]DEBATE PERIOD[/h1]

[p]There is no maximum limit on how long a bill can be debated on ([strike]filibustering time[/strike]), though posting on a thread that hasn't been posted on in months is considered gravedigging and is frowned upon (instead, make a new thread linking to the old one if you would like to revisit an idea). However, there is a [i]mandatory debate period[/i], which is the minimum amount of time a specific draft of a bill must be debated before it can be put to a vote. Each type of bill has a different mandatory debate period: (Hint: the mandatory debate period of a bill is the same as its voting period and vice versa)[/p]
[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (general laws, resolutions, appointment approvals, etc.)  must be debated on for at least three days.
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (constitutional laws, resolutions,...) and [em]treaties[/em] must be debated on for at least five days.
[/list]

[p]You don't usually need to care about the debate period since the Chair of Assembly will handle it for you. When no one is posting anymore in a debate and the mandatory period still hasn't been reached, people will just wait until it is reached and move to the next step. However, there are times when the wait is not worth it (usually when there's unanimous agreement and the issue is urgent), and this is when the debate period waiving power of the Chair comes into play.[/p]

[h3]Waiving mandatory debate period[/h3]

[p]There are special occasions when the topic of a debate doesn't justify its mandatory period. The Chair of Assembly can waive the mandatory debate period of a debate if a legislator motions for them to do so (by posting a waiving request such as "I motion to waive the debate period of this bill because..."), another kegislator seconds the motion, and no other legislator objects against in within 24 hours. There needs to be a reason that is deemed sufficient by the Chair for the Chair to waive the mandatory debate period.[/p]

[/box]

[box][anchor=motion][/anchor]
{{ headers.gen_sub_header(title='MOTIONING') }}

[hr]

[p]If you think the debate is done and you want to bring your bill to the next step after debating (voting), you need to motion it to vote and your motion needs to be seconded by another legislator. To motion a bill to vote, just post "I motion this bill to vote" in the bill's forum thread, another legislator will second it by posting "I second this", or something to that effect. Any legislator can motion a bill to vote or second it.[/p]

[h3]Do NOT motion in these circumstances:[/h3]
[list]
[*]The minimum debate period has not been met (unless the Chair has waived it).
[*]There are still a lot of disagreements about your bill.
[*]Your bill hasn't been properly formatted or has other errors.
[/list]

[p]The Chair of Assembly can delay the vote if the above circumstances exist.[/p]

[h3]Competing bills[/h3]

[p]Sometimes, a debate can create competing bills. Someone might post a bill that solves the same issue in a different way. After competing bills have been motioned to vote, they are brought to vote simultaneously.[/p]

[/box]

[box][anchor=vote][/anchor]

[hr]

[h1]INTRODUCTION TO VOTING[/h1]

[p]After a bill has been motioned and seconded to vote, the Chair of Assembly will bring the bill to vote. If the Chair is vacant or unable to do this, their deputies or any legislator can do this instead. The bill will pass and become official law if there are enough legislators that vote in favour of the bill. The number of votes required for a bill to pass is different for each type of bills and is discussed below. Voting in the Assembly happens in the [url=f_voting_chamber]Voting Chamber[/url].[/p]

[hr]

[anchor=voting_intro][/anchor][h1]HOW TO VOTE[/h1]

[p]All votes in the Assembly happen on our forum, in the [url=f_voting_chamber]Voting Chamber[/url] area. The Chair will create a dedicated thread for the bill that is brought to vote. The thread will be where everyone votes on the bill. You will be notified on Discord and in NationStates via a dispatch with a link to the thread when a vote happens. There are two ways to vote on the bill in the thread:[/p]

[h3]Vote using poll[/h3]

[p]Above a voting thread there is a poll which you can choose Aye to vote for, Nay to vote against, or Abstain. Click on the choice you want, then click [i]Vote[/i] to cast your vote. To undo your vote and vote again, click the small [i]Undo[/i] button near the thread's title.[/p]

[img]poll_voting_example[/img]

[h3]Vote using post[/h3]

[p]If your device doesn't support poll (Tapatalk) then you can vote by posting your vote on the thread. Click [i]New Reply[/i] on the thread, write "Aye", "Nay", or "Abstain" then post it. You can edit your vote if you want until the voting period is over.[/p]

[p][danger]NOTE: Do not vote using poll and post at the same time. Your vote will be discarded if you do that. Also, you are not allowed to post any commentary on the voting thread. Post them in the debate thread instead.[/danger][/p]

[img]post_voting_example[/img]

[h3]Abstain vote[/h3]

[p]If you can't choose whether to vote for or against a bill, you [u]need[/u] to choose the Abstain vote option. You can only keep your legislatorship in the next month if you have voted on at least half of the bills in the past month uUnless you just joined in this month of course). Voting abstain is the signal that you do read the bills and are active. Not voting at all means you are inactive and is not recommended if you want to keep your legislatorship.[/p]

[hr]

[anchor=voting_period][/anchor][h1]VOTING PERIOD[/h1]

[p]The voting period of a bill is the same as its minimum debate period:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (general laws, resolutions, appointment approvals) are voted on for three days.
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (constitutional laws, resolutions) and [em]treaties[/em] are voted on for five days.
[/list]

[hr]

[anchor=threshold][/anchor][h1]PASSING REQUIREMENT[/h1]

[p]Each type of bill has different number of votes required for it to pass and become official law:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (general laws, resolutions, appointment approvals) and [em]treaties[/em] require a simple majority of aye votes to pass (more than 50% of Legislators vote Aye, not counting the Abstain voters)
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (constitutional laws, resolutions), [em]recall resolutions[/em] (used to recall government officials), and [em]Motions of No Confidence[/em] (used to recall the entire Cabinet) require a three-fifths supermajority of Aye votes to pass (more than three-fifths or 60% of legislators voting Aye, not counting the Abstain voters)
[/list]

[h3]Competing bills[/h3]

[p]If a debate gives us multiple competing bills, all of them will be brought to vote simultaneously, but only one of them can pass. A bill needs to satisfy the above vote number requirement [u]and have more votes than the other competing bills for it to pass[/u]. If all bills don't satisfy the vote number requirement then none of them pass.[/p]

[h3]Gameside referendum[/h3]

[p]For some exceptionally important bills which affect the gameside community, the Chair may decide that a gameside referendum should occur. The [url=lc_intro]Local Council[/url] is in charge in organizing the referendum.[/p]

[hr]

[anchor=finalize][/anchor][h1]FINALIZING A VOTE[/h1]

[p]After a vote has finished, if it meets the vote number requirement above then it will become law and be archived in the [url=law_index]Laws Archive[/url]. If a vote doesn't pass, then the proposal is usually dropped. However, sometimes the author of the bill will revisit the bill and debate and discuss more, bring a new version of their bill to vote. However, the Chair will not allow for a bill that is not significantly different from a failed bill to go back to vote within two weeks of the end of the original vote, unless there is a good reason to.[/p]

[p]After finishing this guide, you now know everything you need to know in order to make legislation, debate, and vote on it. If you forget something, you can use the [url=assembly_procedures]Assembly procedures[/url] dispatch to look up something instead of this guide, as it is much shorter and straight to the point. Happy legislating![/p]
