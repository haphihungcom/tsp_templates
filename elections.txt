[h2]Local Council elections[/h2]

[p]Elections for the three seats of the [url=lc_intro]Local Council[/url] (LC) which is the gameside part of the government and handles interaction with the gameside community happen once every 3 months (June, October, February). Local Council candidates are voted on by World Assembly nations in our region using the regional poll feature. First-past-the-post (FPTP) voting method is used for these elections. Usually, three candidates with the most votes will get the seats. However, when there are a lot of candidates (more than what NationStates's poll feature can handle), the procedure is different.[/p]

[p]One needs to be a citizen of the South Pacific in order to run for these elections.[/p]

[h2]Delegate elections[/h2]

[p][url=delegate_intro]The Delegate[/url] of the South Pacific, who is the head of state and holds the gameside delegate position along with all administrative powers that come with it, is elected every 6 months (January, June) by a two-step process. In the first step, legislators of the Assembly will vote on candidates using Instant-runoff Voting. Two candidates with the most votes will go to the second step where they will be voted on by World Assembly nations in the gameside using First-past-the-post. The candidate which gets the most vote will win the position.[/p]

[p]The Delegate position is the hardest position to run. One needs to be a legislator and have a high amount of popularity on both the gameside and forumside community.[/p]

[h2]How do I vote in an election?[/h2]

[p]Voting is carried out on either the forum or the gameside (Using the regional poll feature) depends on who are the electors. For forum elections, you usually post your ballot on a designated public thread (Which the Election Commission will create before an election) or message your ballot (If you want to go secret) to a designated forum account (Currently, it is [url=secret_ballot_forum_acc]{{ misc.secret_ballot_forum_acc }}[/url]). For gameside elections, just click on the option you want on the poll then click [b]Vote[/b].[/p]

[p]Each type of elections have different voting methods and some methods can be confusing to newcomers but a guide will always be posted before an election to instruct you. However, if you want, just [url=elections_voting_methods]click here[/url] to learn about voting methods that we use.[/p]

[h2]How do I run in an election?[/h2]

[p]In order to run for a position, for forumside elections, you declare your candidacy along with your conflicts of interests (CoI) on a designated public thread (Which is always created by the Election Commission before an election). For gameside elections, you send the candidacy declaration and CoI via telegram to a designated nation (For Local Council elections, it is a Local Councilor's nation). Conflicts of Interests is a short writing about your past (What positions you have held, what regions you have joined,...).[/p]
