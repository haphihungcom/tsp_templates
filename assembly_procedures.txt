[h1]Proposals, types of bills, and formatting[/h1]

[p]Any legislator can propose legislation to the Assembly (proposed legislation is called a bill). These are the main types of bills:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]Law:[/em] A system of rules that guides how the government should run.
[*][em]Amendment:[/em] Changes to existing laws.
[*][em]Treaty:[/em] An agreement between our region and foreign entities.
[*][em]Appointment approval:[/em] Approval for the appointment of an individual to a government office.
[*][em]Resolution:[/em] Everything else, including recalls, dealing with remnants of repealed legislation, delaying elections, requesting the government to do something, etc.
[/list]

[p]Bills can also be categorized into:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]General bills:[/em] General laws, amendments, resolutions, appointments, and treaties
[*][em]Constitutional bills:[/em] Laws, amendments, resolutions which form the foundation of our community, are considered fundamental to governance, or otherwise are considered of great importance (E.g. the Charter, election laws,...)
[/list]

[h2]Formatting standard[/h2]

[p]The formatting of a bill of any type should conform to the standard specified in [law]the Law Standards Act[/law]. This is a summary the standards:[/p]

[h3]Layout rules[/h3]
[list]
[*]Titles should be bolded and centered.
[*]Subtitles should be italicized and centered.
[*]Articles should be numbered and bolded.
[*]Sections should be numbered with parentheses, unless there is only one section without any sub-sections.
[*]Sub-sections should be lettered with lowercase letters.
[*]All titled sections should be followed by a line break before starting a new section
[*]Addendums should be numbered and at the bottom of all bills, regardless of where the referenced material is in the bill, and placed in a quote box.
[/list]

[h3]Amendment rules[/h3]
[list]
[*]Note which law(s), article(s), and section(s) are being amended, and quote only those parts.
[*]Additions of words should be formatted in green text.
[*]Subtractions of words should be formatted in red text with a strike-through.
[*]Ellipses should be used to indicate an intentional omission of a whole article, section, or sub-section.
[/list]

[p]A bill [i]needs[/i] to comply with the standard before it can be brought to a vote. The [url=coa]Chair of Assembly[/url] will typically correct the formatting for you, however it is recommended to do this by yourself first, the Chair is not there to do the entire formatting work for you.[/p]

[h1]Debate[/h1]

[p]After a bill has been proposed, the debate period begins. This is when legislators discuss and improve the bill.[/p]

[h2]Mandatory debate period[/h2]

[p]Bills need to be debated for a mandatory period of time before they can be brought to vote. The debate period for a particular draft of a bill begins when it was proposed, and lasts for the same amount of time that it would be at vote.[/p]

[h2]Competing bills[/h2]

[p]If a debate leads to multiple bills which address the same issue, the [url=coa]Chair of the Assembly[/url] will separately and simultaneously bring these competing bills to vote, following the standard voting procedure below. The bill which receives the most votes in favor and meets the minimum requirement for passage will become law.[/p]

[h2]Waiving mandatory debate period[/h2]

[p]The Chair may waive the mandatory debate period if a legislator motions for them to do so, with a reason deemed sufficient by the Chair. This motion must be seconded by another legislator. If there are no objections to the motion within 24 hours of it being seconded, the period may be waived.[/p]

[h1]Motion[/h1]

[p]Following the completion of the mandatory debate period, any legislator may motion to vote. This motion must be seconded by another legislator before a vote can commence.[/p]

[h1]Vote[/h1]

[h2]Voting periods[/h2]
[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (general laws and amendments, resolutions, appointment approvals) are voted on for a minimum period of three days.
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (constitutional laws and resolutions) and [em]treaties[/em] are voted on for a minimum period of five days.
[/list]

[h2]Competing bills[/h2]

[p]In the event of multiple bills which address the same issue, the Chair will separately and simultaneously bring these competing bills to vote, following the standard voting procedure. The bill which receives the most votes in favor and meets the minimum requirement for passage will become law.[/p]

[h2]Finalizing a vote[/h2]

[p]The Chair will finalise the vote by counting the votes and determining whether the bill has passed or failed to pass. They will inform the Assembly of the result and add, amend, or remove laws in [url=law_index]the Laws Index[/url].[/p]

[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (general laws and amendments, appointment approvals, resolutions) and [em]treaties[/em] require a simple majority of those voting to pass.
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (constitutional laws and resolutions), [em]recall resolutions[/em], and [em]Motions of No Confidence[/em] require a three-fifths supermajority of those voting to pass.
[/list]

[h2]Right to conduct votes[/h2]

[p]The right to conduct an Assembly vote is reserved for the Chair but if the Chair is vacant, then a Deputy Chair or any other legislator can conduct the vote instead.[/p]

[h2]Gameside referendum[/h2]

[p]Any bill passed by the Assembly which affects the gameside community or its home-side governance as determined by the Chair does not immediately take effect. Rather, it proceeds to [url=lc_intro]the Local Council[/url] who will arrange for it to be debated and voted upon by the gameside community. Only after it has passed the gameside vote can a bill take effect.[/p]
