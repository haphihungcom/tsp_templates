[/list]

[h3]Formatting standard[/h3]

[p]The formatting of a bill of any type should conform to the standard specified in [law]the Law Standards Act[/law]. The details are specified quite clearly in the law itself. If you don't like to read it, you can read this summary:[/p]

[h4]Layout rules[/h4]
[list]
[*]Titles should be bolded and centered.
[*]Subtitles should be italicized and centered.
[*]Articles should be numbered and bolded.
[*]Sections should be numbered with parentheses, unless there is only one section without any sub-sections.
[*]Sub-sections should be lettered with lowercase letters.
[*]All titled sections should be followed by a line break before starting a new section
[*]Addendum should be numbered and at the bottom of all bills, regardless of where the referenced material is in the bill, and placed in a quote box.
[/list]

[h4]Amendment rules[/h4]
[list]
[*]Only note which law, article, and section is being amended, and quote only that part of the law.
[*]Additions of words should be formatted in green text.
[*]Subtractions of words should be formatted in red text with a strike-through.
[*]Ellipses should be used to indicate an intentional omission of a whole article, section, or sub-section.
[/list]

[p]A bill [i]needs[/i] to comply with the standard before it can be brought to a vote. The [url=coa]Chair of Assembly[/url] will typically correct the formatting for you, however it is recommended to do this by yourself first, the Chair is not there to do the entire formatting work for you.[/p]

[h2]Debate[/h2]

[p]After a bill has been proposed, the debate step will be started. This is when you and other Legislators discuss and improve the bill.[/p]

[h3]Mandatory debate period[/h3]

[p]Bills need to be debated for a mandatory period of time before they can be brought to vote.[/p]
[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] are debated for a minimum period of three days.
[*][em]Constitutional bills and treaties[/em] are debated for a minimum period of five days.
[/list]

[h3]Competing bills[/h3]

[p]If a debate leads to multiple bills which address the same issue, the [url=coa]Chair of the Assembly[/url] will separately and simultaneously bring these competing bills to vote, following the standard voting procedure below. The bill which receives the most votes in favour and meets the minimum requirement for passage will become law.[/p]

[h3]Debate time waiving[/h3]

[p]The Chair may waive the mandatory debate period if a Legislator motions for them to do so. This Motion must be Seconded by another Legislator. If there are no objections to the motion within 24 hours, the period may be waived.[/p]

[h2]Motion[/h2]

[p]Following the completion of the mandatory debate period, any Legislator may motion to Vote. This Motion must be Seconded by another Legislator before a vote can commence.[/p]

[h2]Vote[/h2]

[h3]Voting periods[/h3]
[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (General laws and amendments, resolutions, appointment approvals) are voted on for a minimum period of three days.
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (Constitutional laws and resolutions) and [em]treaties[/em] are voted on for a minimum period of five days.
[/list]

[h3]Competing bills[/h3]

[p]In the event of multiple bills which address the same issue, the Chair will separately and simultaneously bring these competing bills to vote, following the standard voting procedure. The bill which receives the most votes in favour and meets the minimum requirement for passage will become law.[/p]

[h3]Finalizing a vote[/h3]

[p]The Chair will finalise the vote by counting the votes and determining whether the bill has passed or failed to pass. They will inform the Assembly of the result and add, amend, or remove laws in [url=law_index]the laws index[/url].[/p]

[list]
[*][em]General bills[/em] (General laws and amendments, appointment approvals, resolutions) and [em]treaties[/em] require a simple majority of those voting to pass.
[*][em]Constitutional bills[/em] (Constitutional laws and resolutions), [em]recall resolutions[/em], and [em]Motions of No Confidence[/em] require a three-fifths supermajority of those voting to pass.
[/list]

[h3]Vote conducting right[/h3]

[p]The right to conduct an Assembly vote is reserved for the Chair but if the Chair is vacant, then a deputy chair or any other Legislator can conduct the vote instead.[/p]

[h3]Gameside referendum[/h3]

[p]Any bill passed by the Assembly which affects the gameside community or its home-side governance as determined by the Chair does not immediately take effect. Rather, it proceeds to [url=lc_intro]the Local Council[/url] who will arrange for it to be debated and voted upon by the gameside community. Only after it has passed the gameside vote can a bill take effect.[/p]
