[title]Voting methods used in elections[/title]
[subtitle]in the Coalition of the South Pacific[/subtitle]

[p]The South Pacific uses a wide variety of ways to count votes in different types of elections due to the differences in the technical platform and representation requirements. These methods are specified in [law]the Elections Act[/law] for forumside government's elections and in [url=lc_elections]the Local Council's election law[/url]. This dispatch will explain all of them in layman terms and give examples to make things easier to understand.[/p]

[h1]First-past-the-post (FPTP)[/h1]

[p][url=lc_intro]Local Council[/url] elections and the gameside stage of [url=delegate_elections]Delegate elections[/url] use this method via the gameside poll system. FPTP is chosen due to the limitations of the gameside poll system.[/p]

[h2]How it works[/h2]

[p]The mechanic is simple, you can only vote for one candidate, whoever get the most votes will win.[/p]

[h1]Approval Voting (AV)[/h1]

[p][url=coa]Chair of Assembly[/url] elections and the forumside stage of Delegate elections use this method. Electors list out candidates they vote for on their ballot with this method. AV is chosen due to its suitability for independent apolitical positions that require consensus.[/p]

[h2]How it works[/h2]

[p]It is like FPTP, except you can vote for multiple candidates. Like FPTP, whoever get the most votes will win.[/p]

[spoiler=[p]Example[/p]][p]Assume you have 3 candidates: Coconut, Iced Tea, Lampshade. And there are three ballots as follow:[/p]
[box][h3]Example ballot 1[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Example ballot 2[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Example ballot 3[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[p]The result will be:[/p]
[list][*]Coconut: 3 votes
[*]Iced Tea: 2 vote
[*]Lampshade: 1 vote
[/list]

[p]Coconut is the winner[/p]
[/spoiler]


[h1]Instant-runoff Voting (IRV)[/h1]

[p]IRV is a form of voting which you make a ballot by sorting a list of candidates based on how you like them. The [url=cabinet_elections]Cabinet elections[/url] use this method to count votes. IRV is arguably the most difficult to understand method and is designed for political positions such as Cabinet ministers.[/p]

[h2]How it works[/h2]

[p]In IRV, a ballot is a list of candidates sorted by the elector's order of preference. The votes are counted using the following procedure:[/p]

[h3]First round[/h3]

[p]At the beginning, the number of [i]first-preference votes[/i] (Ballots that rank a candidate first) for each candidate are counted. If a candidate receives a majority (more than half) of first-preference votes (More than half of the electors place them at the first rank on their ballot), they will win the election. If no one achieves a majority of first-preference votes, then the complicated [i]instant-runoff[/i]rounds will start.[/p]

[h3]Instant-runoff rounds[/h3]

[p]The candidate with the least first-preference votes will be eliminated and their votes will be transferred to other candidates as follow: If the eliminated candidate is ranked 1[sup]st[/sup] on a ballot then after the elimination happens, the 2[sup]nd[/sup]-ranked candidate on the ballot will become the first, the 3[sup]rd[/sup] will become the 2[sup]nd[/sup], and so on. If the eliminated candidate is ranked 2[sup]nd[/sup] on the ballot then the 3[sup]rd[/sup] candidates will become the 2[sup]nd[/sup] and so on, the 1[sup]st[/sup] candidate will still retain their position. This will push some candidates to the first rank on some ballots and increase their first-preferential votes. If a candidate reaches a majority of first-preferential votes after these transfers then they will win, if not, the process will repeat with the next least-first-preferential-votes candidate eliminated and their votes transferred to others. The process will repeat until someone gets a majority of first-preferential votes and wins. Each repetition is called an [i]instant-runoff round[/i].[/p]

[p]That was mind blown isn't it? Here is an example to make things clearer.[/p]

[spoiler=[p]Example[/p]]
[p]Assume you have 3 candidates: Coconut, Iced Tea, Lampshade and 5 ballots casted by 5 electors as follow:[/p]

[box][h3]Elector A[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector B[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector C[/h3]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector D[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector E[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[p]The result will be:[/p]

[table][tr][th]Candidates[/th][th]First-preferential votes[/th][/tr]
[tr][td]Coconut[/td][td]4[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Iced Tea[/td][td]1[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Lampshade[/td][td]0[/td][/tr]
[/table]

[p]Coconut has 4 first-preferential votes (4 ballots ranked them the first) which is a majority so Coconut is the winner![/p]

[p]That is an easy example, here is an example when no one reaches a majority of first-preferential votes.[/p]

[box][h3]Elector A[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector B[/h3]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector C[/h3]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector D[/h3]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[/box]

[box][h3]Elector E[/h3]
[p]Lampshade[/p]
[p]Coconut[/p]
[p]Iced Tea[/p]
[/box]

[p]The result will be:[/p]

[table][tt]Round 1[/tt]
[tr][th]Candidate | Ballot rank[/th][th]A[/th][th]B[/th][th]C[/th][th]D[/th][th]E[/th][th]First-preferential Votes[/th][/tr]
[tr][th]Coconut[/th][td]1[/td][td]2[/td][td]1[/td][td]2[/td][td]2[/td][td][color=#00ff00]2[/color][/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Lampshade[/th][td]3[/td][td]3[/td][td]3[/td][td]1[/td][td]1[/td][td][color=#00ff00]2[/color][/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Iced Tea[/th][td]2[/td][td]1[/td][td]2[/td][td]3[/td][td]3[/td][td][color=#ff0000]1[/color][/td][/tr]
[/table]

[p]As you can see, no one gets a majority of first-preferential votes, so an instant-runoff round is needed. Iced Tea has the least first-preferential votes so they are eliminated and their votes are transferred to others. Ballots which rank Iced Tea 1[sup]st[/sup] will have their 2[sup]nd[/sup] candidate take over the 1[sup]st[/sup] spot, 3[sup]rd[/sup] take over the 2[sup]nd[/sup] and so on.[/p]

[table][tt]Round 2[/tt]
[tr][th]Candidate | Ballot rank[/th][th]A[/th][th]B[/th][th]C[/th][th]D[/th][th]E[/th][th]First-preferential Votes[/th][/tr]
[tr][th]Coconut[/th][td]1[/td][td]1[/td][td]1[/td][td]2[/td][td]2[/td][td][color=#00ff00]3[/color][/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Lampshade[/th][td]2[/td][td]2[/td][td]2[/td][td]1[/td][td]1[/td][td][color=#ff0000]2[/color][/td][/tr]
[/table]

[p]Coconut jumps from 2[sup]nd[/sup] to 1st on ballot B to fill in the spot of eliminated originally 1[sup]st[/sup]-ranked Iced Tea. Lampshade also jumps from 3[sup]rd[/sup] to 2[sup]nd[/sup] on ballot A, B, C to fill in the spot of originally 2[sup]nd[/sup]-ranked Iced Tea.[/p]

[p]After this round, Coconut receives one more first-preferential vote. With 3 votes which is a majority, Coconut wins![/p]
