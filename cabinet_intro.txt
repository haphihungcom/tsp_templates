[p]The Executive branch of the South Pacific is tasked with executing the laws created by our Legislature ([url=assembly_intro]the Assembly[/url]). It consists of three ministries and a number of independent institutions and is headed by members of the Cabinet including three ministers and a Prime Minister. The Executive branch is the primary activity-generating part of the region as it organizes and runs everything from roleplay, events, festivals, military operations, SWAN,... to diplomatic relations. It is the institution with the most employee in the region. Getting involved in the Executive branch is one of the main ways that you can participate in NationStates regional politics and become a politician or just to help the region.[/p]


[h2]Structure[/h2]

[p]The Executive branch is run by the Cabinet of the South Pacific which consists of three ministers and a Prime Minister who is the head of government along with a number of advisors and deputies. The three ministers lead the three respective ministries which run a specific sector of the region:[/p]

[list][*][url=fa_intro][b]Ministry of Foreign Affairs - MoFA[/b][/url]: The MoFA cares about relating to other regions, building treaties, running embassies and so on.
[*][url=ra_intro][b]Ministry of Regional Affairs - MoRA[/b][/url]: The MoRA is all about welcoming new players to the region and keeping activity going with fun events, festivals, roleplays, and so on. It is also about maintaining the regional journalism. This is the biggest ministry of the three.
[*][url=spsf_intro][b]Ministry of Military Affairs - MoMA[/b][/url]: The MoMA deals with running the South Pacific Special Forces (SPSF), our regional military. The SPSF participates in what known as [i]Military Gameplay[/i] or [i]Raiding/Defending[/i] (R/D) which is an area of gameplay that uses the game mechanics to invade other regions or defend them from being invaded.
[/list]

[p]Details on how to work for a ministry(s) can be found [url=government_jobs]here[/url].[/p]

[h2]The Delegate[/h2]

[p][url=delegate_intro][b]Delegate of the South Pacific[/b][/url] holds the gameside Delegate position along with all technical administration powers of the region on gameside. The Delegate's job is to interact with the gameside community and along with [url=lc_intro]the Local Council[/url], acts as the bridge between the gameside and forumside community. The Delegate is elected by Legislators of the Assembly and gameside World Assembly nations via a two-step process.[/p]

[h2]Independent institutions[/h2]

[p]The Executive branch also has institutions that don't lie under the leadership of the Cabinet. These institutions typically handle regional security and stability so they are required to not be interfered by politics. Despite that, the Cabinet still involves in them in one way or another by appointing or approving members of these institutions. Currently, these institutions are:[/p]

[list]
[*][url=crs_intro][b]Council on Regional Security - CRS[/b][/url]: It consists of experienced and trustworthy members of the region and is responsible for monitoring and responding to regional security issues as well as operating the main regional intelligence service.
[*][url=legcomm][b]Legislator Committee - LegComm[/b][/url]: It is a body which handles the admissions of new Legislators. It checks and accepts/rejects Legislator applications and suspends Legislators that cause troubles if necessary.
[*][url=election_commission][b]Election Commission - EC[/b][/url]: It conducts and oversees all elections in our region.
[/list]


[h2]Authority and Executive Orders[/h2]

[p]Cabinet members have absolute authority over the ministry they are handling and can appoint any deputy and advisors as they see fit. The Cabinet can collectively issue an Executive Order (EO) to address immediate issues created by holes in laws which will immediately have the effect of law.[/p]

[p]The Cabinet appoints a number of positions in the government such as [url=court_intro]High Court[/url] justices, Legislator Committee members,... All major Cabinet appointments require approval from the Assembly. The Assembly can recall the Cabinet if it wishes to do so.[/p]

[h2]Get Involved[/h2]

[p]The Executive branch offers a wide variety of jobs that you can apply without any special requirement aside from being a citizen of our region. Visit [url=get_involved]this dispatch[/url] or the dispatches of each ministry to find more information. Getting a job in the Executive branch then working your way up the ladder is the most common way to gain popularity and win elections in our region so you should give it a try if you have the time and passion for public administration or just want to make things better and have fun![/p]


[h2]Cabinet elections[/h2]

[p]The Cabinet is elected every four months (February, July, October) by Legislators of the Assembly. Cabinet elections last for a week and use [url=voting_methods]Instant-runoff Voting[/url] (IRV) as the voting method.
