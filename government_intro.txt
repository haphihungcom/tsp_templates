[p]The Government of the South Pacific is the entity that governs [region]the South Pacific[/region] region and its community. It is a parliamentary republic and is one of NationStates oldest and biggest democracies. Its job is to engage, moderate, and protect the community of this region. The Government belongs to a part of NationStates known as [i]Gameplay[/i] or more specifically, [i]Regional Politics[/i]. This part of the game mainly deals with managing a region and developing it into the greatest or worst place, depends on you, your friends, or your enemies. If you like realistic politics, making laws, interacting with other, or trying to make something better for everyone then this is the place for you![/p]

[p]Regional politics is not a roleplay thing as it involves real powers and responsibilities. Unlike roleplay, regional politics doesn't require pretense, because there are actual game mechanics which allow its moves to be played out and, in this case, actual votes will get actual candidates elected to actual roles with actual powers that they can actually carry out to the benefit (or detriment) of the region. It may sound scary but remember, this is still just a game! We have an abundance of guides and tutorials to assist you along the way if you choose to play in this side of the game.[/p]

[p]If you are an absolute beginner, we recommend you to begin from [url=politics_guide]this handy guide[/url] on our politics.[/p]


[h2]Does it have real purposes and powers?[/h2]

[p]Yes, members of the government are tasked with jobs such as community engaging, helping new nations, operating [url=spsf_intro]the military[/url], making sure everything is nice and neat,... Some members of the Government have real administrative powers such as moderating the message board, banning/ejecting nations from the region, changing the World Factbook Entry,... while others have the power to vote on and recall those members, decide how they should do their job by making laws,... In a sense, it is like an administrator and community organizer team which operates by mechanisms of real-life governments.[/p]

[h2]The overall structure[/h2]

[p]The Government of the South Pacific is a democratic parliamentary republic with three-branch checks and balances and a separate head of state (Delegate) and head of government (Prime Minister). The Charter of the South Pacific is the supreme law of the land. The Government is divided into two parts.[/p]

[h3]Gameside government[/h3]

[p][url=lc_intro]The Local Council (LC)[/url] is the governing body of the gameside. It consists of three members that are elected every 3 months by regional nations that are in the World Assembly. The Local Council mostly deals with engaging and organizing the gameside community which includes RMB (Regional Message Board) chatters, RMB roleplayers,... and acts as a bridge between the gameside and forumside community of the region.[/p]

[h3]Forumside government[/h3]

[p]This is the supreme governing body of the region, an equivalent to a national/federal government of a real-life country. It resides on the forum of the region and consists of three branches:[/p]
[list]
[*][em]Legislature:[/em] [url=assembly_intro]The Assembly[/url] is the unicameral parliament of the region. It consists of legislators who voluntarily join by applying here. It makes laws, resolutions, elects/approves/recalls members of other branches,... Its matters are managed by the Chair of Assembly (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.coa|nation }}).
[*][em]Executive:[/em] The Executive branch is headed by the Prime Minister (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.pm|nation }}) who is the head of government and the Cabinet. The Delegate (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.delegate|nation }}) is the head of state who only has ceremonial roles but is granted technical administrative powers by the game itself. The Cabinet consists of the:
[list][*][em]Minister of Foreign Affairs[/em] (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.mofa|nation }}) who leads the [url=fa_intro]Ministry of Foreign Affairs[/url] (MoFA). The MoFA cares about relating to other regions, building treaties, running embassies and so on.
[*][em]Minister of Regional Affairs[/em] (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.mora|nation }}) who leads the [url=ra_intro]Ministry of Regional Affairs[/url] (MoRA). The MoRA is all about welcoming new players to the region and keeping activity going with fun events, festivals, roleplays, and so on. It is also about maintaining the regional journalism. This is the biggest job of the three.
[*][em]Minister of Military Affairs[/em] (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.moma|nation }}) who leads the [url=spsf_intro]Ministry of Military Affairs[/url] (MoMA) and deals with running the South Pacific Special Forces (SPSF), our regional military. The SPSF participates in what known as [i]Military Gameplay[/i] or [i]Raiding/Defending[/i] (R/D) which is an area of gameplay that uses the game mechanics to invade other regions or defend them from being invaded.
[/list]
[p]The Executive branch employs dozens of personnel such as ambassadors, journalists, roleplayers, event organizers, soldiers, officers, commanders, managers,... all work together to make the region better. The Cabinet and the Prime Minister have the power to issue executive orders and appoint some positions. They are elected every 3 months by the Assembly ([url=elections_intro]Click here[/url] to read more about elections).[/p]
[*][em]Judiciary:[/em] The High Court is the highest and only court of the region, where all matters related to law interpretations and conflicts are resolved. It consists of Associate Justices and is led by the Chief Justice (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.hc_chief_justice|nation }}). Justices are appointed by the Cabinet and approved by the Assembly. Aside from justices,there are also informal roles such as legal text analyzers, court-related event organizers, investigators, paperwork managers,... in this body.
[/list]

[p]Aside from the above, there are a few bodies known as [url=indie_intro]independent institutions[/url] that don't belong to any government ministry such as the [url=crs_intro]Council on Regional Security[/url] (CRS) which handles matters such as protecting the region from intruders, gathering intelligence,...;[url=legcomm]The Legislator Committee[/url] (LegComm) which handles legislator applications;...[/p]
