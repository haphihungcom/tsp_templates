[h2]Term[/h2]

[p]A Cabinet term lasts for four months and there is no term limit.[/p]

[h2]Structure[/h2]

[p]The Cabinet consists of a Prime Minister and three ministers along with deputies and advisors.[/p]

[h3]Prime Minister[/h3]

[p]The Prime Minister (PM) is the leader of the Cabinet and the head of government of the Coalition. True political power of the Executive branch lies in this position.[/p]

[p]The three Cabinet ministers run their respective ministries which handle specific areas of administration, each ministry may be divided further into sectors. Each minister has full authority over their ministry. They can appoint advisors or establish institutions to run the ministry on their behalf if needed.[/p]

[h3]Ministry of Regional Affairs - MoRA[/h3]

[p]The Ministry of Regional Affairs handles the welcoming of new members, organizing events, festivals, managing regional journalism, moderating and encouraging roleplaying,...  In a nut shell, the position is all about everything related to our culture. The ministry is divided into sectors such as integration (Welcoming new members), journalism (Operating regional newspapers), event planning (Planning and organizing events/festivals),... The ministry is run by the Advisory Council ({{ gov_officials.mora_advisory_council|gen_list }}) which is a group of experienced members appointed by the Minister of Regional Affairs (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.mora|nation }}).[/p]

[h3]Ministry of Foreign Affairs - MoFA[/h3]

[p]The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a body responsible for the Coalition's diplomacy, bilateral, and multilateral relations affairs. The MoFA is headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.mofa|nation }}). The MoFA employs ambassadors who run embassies and represent us in other regions along with advisors and deputies who manage the daily operations of the ministry, participate in negotiations with other regions, draft treaties, establish the Coalition's foreign policies,...[/p]

[h3]Ministry of Military Affairs - MoMA[/h3]

[p]The Ministry of Military Affairs operates our regional military: The South Pacific Special Forces (SPSF). It is responsible for the defense of the region, building military activity, conducting military operations, and running military intelligence. It consists of ranked members such as trainees, soldiers, officers, commanders,... The daily operations of the SPSF is managed by the General Corps ({{ gov_officials.general_corps|gen_list }}) and the Minister of Military Affairs (Incumbent: {{ gov_officials.moma|nation }}).[/p]

[h2]Powers[/h2]

[h3]Appoint advisors and deputies[/h3]

[p]Any Cabinet member can appoint anyone as advisers and deputies as they see fit. Advisers and deputies are considered to be junior members of the Cabinet and are granted privileges (E.g. Access to classified Cabinet-only documents) and powers (E.g. Manage a project) at the discretion of the appointing Cabinet member but they will not have any voting right on any decision which requires voting such as [url=cabinet_eo]Executive Orders[/url], [url=proscriptions]Proscriptions[/url],...[/p]

[p]Advisers and deputies can work as individuals or can be grouped into institutions like the MoRA's Advisory Council, the MoFA Team (Defunct),...[/p]

[box][ref][law]Section 15, Article IV of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]

[h3]Appoint positions in other institutions[/h3]

[p]Several independent institutions of the Executive branch itself and other branches are appointed or nominated by the Cabinet. All of these appointments require an approval vote from the Assembly which requires a simple majority of those voting in order to pass.[/p]

[h3]Appoint Associate Justices of the High Court[/h3]

[p]Associate Justices of the High Court (The Judicial branch) are appointed by the Cabinet and such appointments require approval votes from the Assembly. One needs to be a Legislator and satisfies several requirements in the Judicial Act in order for the Cabinet to appoint them. The Cabinet can appoint as many Associate Justices as it likes, however, if there aren't enough justices for the High Court to operate normally or a new Chief Justice cannot be chosen (by Associate Justices) then the Cabinet will be forced to appoint more as required.[/p]

[h3]Appoint members of the Legislator Committee[/h3]

[p]The Cabinet appoints the three members of the Legislator Committee, the body which processes Legislator applications. Legislator Committee appointments require approval votes from the Assembly.[/p]

[anchor=legcomm_emergency_appointment][/anchor]
[h4]Emergency appointments of Legislator Committee members[/h4]

[p]When there is no member available on the Committee (due to vacancy or leave) and there is something important to perform, the Cabinet can appoint an emergency member to handle the matter. This emergency member will have to leave the Committee one week after the normal members return or the Cabinet rescinds the appointment. The [url=crs_intro]Council on Regional Security[/url] (CRS) may stop an emergency appointment if there is something wrong about the appointee.[/p]

[h3]Nominate members of the Council on Regional Security[/h3]

[p]The Cabinet and the Delegate can jointly nominate members for the Council on Regional Security (CRS), the body which handles the Coalition's security matters. The nominees need to satisfy several technical requirements of CRS members (as listed in the relevant part of the Charter) in order to be nominated. A nomination will be subjected to review by the CRS itself. If 2/3 of the members in the CRS object then the nomination will not move forward. Otherwise, the nomination will be passed to the Assembly for an approval vote. If the vote passes then the nominee will officially become a member of the CRS.[/p]

[ref][law]Article IX of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]

[h2]Issue Executive Orders (EO)[/h2]

[p]The Cabinet can issue Executive Orders (EO) with an unanimous consent among the ministers and the Prime Minister. An Executive Order will immediately have the effect of law after it has been issued. After being issued, the Executive Order will be presented to the Assembly for a vote on whether it should remain in effect or not. If the vote fails, the Executive Order will expire and its effects will be reversed. Executive Orders should only be issued to address an emergency problem caused by holes or ambiguities in a law.[/p]

[p]Example: In May of 2018, all Legislator Committee members were vacant and there were a bunch of unprocessed Legislator applications. Because there was no law to define what to do with these applications when there is no one to process them, the Cabinet issued an Executive Order to appoint an emergency Legislator Committee member for the job. Currently, this is not necessary anymore as a section about this was added to the Legislator Committee Act (See [url=#legcomm_emergency_appointment]Emergency appointments of Legislator Committee members[/url]).[/p]

[h2]High Court's invalidation power[/h2]

[p]Any decision from the Cabinet, from an Executive Order to a normal directive, can be voided by the High Court if such decisions violate anything in the Charter of the South Pacific or any other constitutional law such as [law]the Elections Act[/law].[/p]

[h2]Elections and recalls[/h2]

[h3]Cabinet elections[/h3]

[p]Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister are elected every four months (February, June, October) by Legislators of the Assembly. A Cabinet election typically lasts for one and a half weeks. The nomination period (when Legislators can declare their candidacy) lasts for six days. The campaign period (When candidates can campaign to convince people to vote for them) begins three days after the election starts and lasts for a week. After the campaign period ends, a voting period of three days begins. Cabinet elections use Instant-runoff Voting (IRV) as the voting method. Voters rank their candidates on the ballot in their order of preference with this method.[/p]

[p]After the election concludes and the winners are found, the new Cabinet will move in and the old one will move out after a week.[/p]

[/ref][/box]

[h3]Recalls[/h3]

[p]Any member of the Cabinet can be recalled by the Assembly with a Recall Resolution for dereliction of duty, abuse of authority, or violations of the law. Any Legislator can initiate a Recall Resolution against a Cabinet member. The Resolution will be debated for three days. If the Resolution receives a motion and a second, it will be put on a vote. In order for the Resolution to pass, there needs to be a 3/5 majority of those voting. Immediately after the resolution is passed, the Cabinet member will be removed from office. Read the [url=#vacancies]Vacancies section[/url] to know who will replace the spot if a Cabinet member is removed.[/p]

[box][ref][law]Section 1, Article XI of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]


[h3]Motion of No Confidence (MoNC)[/h3]

[p]All Cabinet members can be recalled at the same time by the Assembly with a Motion of No Confidence (MoNC). A MoNC can be initiated by any Legislator and will be debated for three days after being introduced. If a MoNC receives a motion and a second, it will be put on a vote. The vote needs a 3/5 majority in order to pass. If passes, a special Cabinet election will happen to fill the spots left by removed Cabinet members. MoNC is usually initiated if everyone has lost faith in the effectiveness and activities of the Executive branch of the government.[/p]

[box][ref][law]Section 2, Article XI of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]
[anchor=vacancies][/anchor]
[h3]Vacancies[/h3]

[p]If a Cabinet office is vacant (Because the holder has resigned for example), a special election for that office will start if there is more than half of the term remains, if there is less than half of the term remains or the office is vacant because nobody ran in its election, the Cabinet can appoint any Legislator as a replacement until the next regularly scheduled election.[/p]

[box][ref][law]Article 6 of the Elections Act[/law][/ref][/box]

[h2]Independent institutions[/h2]

[p]Independent institutions including the Legislator Committee, and the Council on Regional Security follow different laws than the Cabinet despite the fact that all belong to the Executive branch. For more information about laws relating to these institutions, read:[/p]
