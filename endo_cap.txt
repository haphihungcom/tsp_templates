[title]The Endorsement Cap[/title]

[p][b]The Endorsement Cap[/b] or [b]Endo Cap[/b] is a limit on how many endorsements your nation is legally allowed to have. Your endorsement count should not be higher than this limit. This acts as a security guard to prevent nations from having too many endorsements and being in the danger zone of pulling a coup.[/p]

[center][h3]The current endorsement cap is 400[/h3][/center]

[h2]What happens if I exceed the endorsement cap?[/h2]

[p]If you exceed the endorsement cap, a member nation of the [url=crs_intro]Council on Regional Security[/url] (CRS) will send you a telegram to notify that you have exceeded it and instruct you to lower your endorsement count until you are compliance with the cap again.[/p]

[p]Please don't be scared if this happens as it is a common occurrence and is often accidental! You just need to be calm and follow the CRS nation's instructions.[/p]

[h2]How can I reduce my endorsement count to comply with the cap again?[/h2]

[p]You can reduce it by:[/p]
[list][*][url=ns_telegram]Sending a telegram[/url] to some nations to ask them to withdraw endorsements from you. This is [u]the best way[/u] as you will only lose enough endorsements to comply with the endorsement cap again.
[*]Resigning from the World Assembly (Go to [url=ns_wa]the World Assembly page[/url] then click Resign) then join it again. This is the fastest way but you will lose all endorsements.
[*]Withdrawing your endorsement from some nations so that they will withdraw their endorsements from you. This way is non-guarantee as they may not be aware of you doing this.
[/list]

[h2]What would happen if I refuse to lower my endorsement count?[/h2]

[p]Your nation will receive repeated telegrams seeking compliance. If you continue to refuse, you will be ejected from this region by a CRS nation or the Delegate.[/p]

[h2]Who sets and enforces the endorsement cap?[/h2]

[p]This is the duty of the [url=crs_intro]Council on Regional Security[/url] (CRS).[/p]
