[p]Instant-runoff Voting (IRV) with Optional Preferential Voting (OPV) is used for Cabinet elections. To vote, you just need to rank candidates based on your preferences on a ballot. Counting votes using this method is a little bit complex and you can read [url=elections_voting_methods]this dispatch[/url] to know more about it.[/p]

[h2]Voting guide[/h2]

[p]The vote will be conducted on our regional forum in a thread designated by the Election Commission.[/p]

[*][em]Step 1:[/em] Read the [i]Information and Nominations[/i] thread which is pinned in the Election Center subforum (This subforum will be uncovered when an election starts) for information on the current election, where candidates post their campaign, and where the voting thread is.
[*][em]Step 2:[/em] Read the campaign post of [u]all[/u] candidates to know who to vote for, ask them some questions if you want.
