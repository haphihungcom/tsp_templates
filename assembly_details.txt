[h1]Membership[/h1]

[p]Anyone who has a nation in the South Pacific can apply for legislatorship and become a member of the Assembly. If one applies for legislatorship, their application will be reviewed by a dedicated independent institution known as the Legislator Committee. If the review passes, the applicant will officially become a legislator and have access to relevant areas on the forum and Discord server. Applications are reviewed primarily for vetting out those who apply in bad faith to spy on or subvert the Coalition.[/p]

[p]Legislators can have a Leave of Absence (LoA) or can resign at any time by posting in [url=f_assembly_office]the appropriate areas[/url].[/p]

[h1]Powers[/h1]

[h2]Create legislation[/h2]

[p]The Assembly is the legislature of the Coalition, so its main task is to create laws.[/p]

[p]Any legislator can propose a legislation on any topic as a draft. The draft will be debated by other legislators as needed to refine it. When the draft receives a motion and a second, it will be brought to a vote. The required length of debating and voting along with the required number of votes to pass are different based on the type of legislation. A legislation which is considered "constitutional" (by having an article which says so) usually has a longer debate and vote and a higher required vote majority to pass.[/p]

[p]A Minister of Defense's appointment of General for the South Pacific Special Forces (SPSF) and Cabinet's appointment of Associate Justice for the High Court and member for the Legislator Committee (LegComm) require a simple majority approval vote from the Assembly.[/p]

[h3]Approve Council on Regional Security nominations[/h3]

[p]The Council on Regional Security (CRS) nominates members to the CRS. After presenting the nomination to the Assembly, there is an approval vote. A simple majority is needed for the approval vote to pass. If approved, the nominated member will officially be admitted to the body.[/p]

[box][p]For more information on the CRS, visit [url=crs_intro]this dispatch[/url].[/p]

[h2]Elect government officials[/h2]

[anchor=recall][/anchor][h2]Recall government officials[/h2]

[p]Any government official can be recalled by the Assembly via a vote. A recall vote needs a three-fiths supermajority in order to pass. A recall for a government official should only be initiated if the government official does not do their job, abuses authority, or violates the laws.[/p]

[box][ref][law]Section 1, Article XI of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]

[h2]Initiate a Motion of No Confidence[/h2]

[p]The Assembly can initiate a Motion of No Confidence (MoNC) which will recall the entire Cabinet and trigger a special Cabinet election. A MoNC is issued if the Assembly has lost faith in the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. A MoNC will go into effect after a vote which requires a three-fifths majority to pass.[/p]

[box][ref][law]Section 2, Article XI of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]

[h2]Request a Proscription Review[/h2]

[p]The Assembly can require the issuing authority (the Cabinet or the Council on Regional Security) of a proscription to review that proscription via a vote which requires a simple majority to pass. Such a review is typically required to see if a proscription has proper merit and evidence or not.[/p]

[box][p]For more information on proscriptions, visit [url=proscriptions]this dispatch[/url].[/p]

[ref][law]Section 4, Article 3 of the Proscription Act[/law][/ref][/box]

[h2]Approve the continuation of an Executive Order[/h2]

[p]An Executive Order (EO) issued by the Cabinet goes into effect immediately after being issued. After being issued, an EO will automatically be presented to the Assembly for a debate and a vote. The EO will only continue to remain in effect if the vote passes. The vote requires a simple majority to pass.[/p]

[h2]Approve CRS membership requirements[/h2]

[p]The minimum [i]technical requirements[/i] (influence, endorsement count,...) for one to submit an application or be nominated for the Council on Regional Security (CRS) is established by the CRS itself. However, any update to them requires an approval vote from the Assembly. The vote requires a simple majority to pass.[/p]

[ref][law]Section 2, Article IX of the Charter of the South Pacific[/law][/ref][/box]

[h1]High Court's invalidation power[/h1]

[p]The High Court can declare any law or resolution passed by the Assembly unconstitutional and thereby void them if they violate anything in the Charter or other constitutional laws.[/p]

[h1]The Chair of Assembly[/h1]

[p]The Chair of Assembly (CoA) (currently {{ gov_officials.coa|nation }}) is the official who maintains order and handles paperwork in the Assembly. The CoA can appoint any legislator as deputies to help. The Chair is elected by legislators eight days before the term of the current Chair ends (a Chair term usually lasts for four months) via Approval Voting. The CoA has the power to conduct votes, moderate, update the law archive, order the suspension of disruptive legislators, etc.[/p]
