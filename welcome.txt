[title]Welcome to NationStates and the South Pacific![/title]

[p]If you are new to NationStates or are an experienced player but want to learn more about [region]the South Pacific[/region] (TSP) or want to migrate to it, this is the place for you![/p]

[h2]How to play NationStates[/h2]

[p]NationStates is a multiplayer political simulation game that you can play in many ways (We will talk more about them). The most common way to play is to "answer issues". This is the only way you can develop and mold your nation to your liking. Every day, your nation will face certain issues about the economy, society, politics, diplomacy, wars,... Your job as a leader is to decide how to solve these issues.[/p]
[Spoiler=[p]Click to know more...[/p]][p]Click the [i]Issues[/i] button on the top to view what issues your nation is facing. To tackle an issue, click on one. You will see a few solutions to fix the issue present to you. Make up your mind about what solution will fix things the best then click [i]Answer[/i] on the solution you want. After choosing a solution, it will automatically be implemented and a page with changes in the statistics of your nation (such as GDP, civil rights rating, average income,...) the solution created will show up along with a few funny news headlines your decision caused. It is up to you to make decisions that turn your nation into an utopia where everyone is happy or the most 1984-ish world ever. There is no way to win or lose the game. Competitions only happen on the [url=ns_nation_census]World Census's rankings[/url] which rank all nations based on some statistics.[/p]

[p]The fun of this is that in many cases, there are unorthodox, weird, extreme, and funny issues and solutions and along with them are quirky changes to your nation that you absolutely did not expect and may make you feel delightful or annoying depend on your political leaning. You cannot micro-control your nation (like directly changing tax rates, arrest people,...) though. Making broad decisions by answering issues is the only way to change these things and move your nation forward. When you play long enough, you will unlock some abilities such as setting leader name, official religion, capital city, or custom pre-title for your nation. Aside from that, you can also gain easter eggs and rank badges on your nation's page.[/p]

[p]If you want to know more about issues and tips on how to properly answer hard ones, you should read [url=ns_pol_faq]this great FAQ[/url] or come over to the [url=nsf_got_issues]Got Issues forum[/url] to get help.[/p][/spoiler]

[p]Although issue answering is the main way to play the game, most people who stick around find joys in [url=roleplay_intro]roleplaying[/url], [url=government_intro]regional politics[/url], writing and debating [url=ns_wa]World Assembly[/url] (Our equivalent of the United Nations) resolutions, [url=spsf_intro]military gameplay[/url] (invading and defending regions),... or just interacting with fellow nations. If you think issue answering is boring, you should try out some of the above areas.[/p]

[h2]What is a region and what is the South Pacific[/h2]

[p]A region is basically a community of nations. You are free to move your nation to any region you like by finding one (Click on [i]The World[/i] on the left to find one), opening its page, then clicking [i]Move [your nation name] to [region][/i] (Example: [i]Move Bigtopia to the North Pacific[/i]). The region you are in right now is [region]the South Pacific[/region] (check the [i]Region[/i] area on your nation page). The South Pacific is one of the five feeder regions which new nations automatically spawn into so you probably came here by chance![/p]

[p][b]The South Pacific[/b], full name is the [b]Coalition of the South Pacific[/b], is one of NationStates's largest and most active regions. We are the home of over {{ test.region_nation_num }} nations. Aside from being big, we are also one of NationStates's oldest and most influential democracies. The community of thousands of nations is governed by a [url=government_intro]democratic republican government[/url] (not roleplay, a real government which has real power) in which any citizen can take parts. We offer a variety of activities ranging from just bantering on the [url=rmb]Regional Message Board[/url] (RMB) to [url=roleplay_intro]roleplaying[/url], [url=ra_intro]writing newspapers, organizing events[/url], [url=swan_intro]collecting endorsements[/url], [url=spsf_intro]invading and defending[/url] other regions from being invaded, [url=assembly_intro]making laws[/url] which govern the entire region,...[/p]
